                January 2014 we opened the 2nd stream of Form 1 – 4 to cater for the influx of students getting
                admitted.

            <p class="about">
                At the end of Form 4 a further National Government exam is sat, The Kenya Certificate of Secondary
                Education and this gives entrance to University for a further 4 years.

                            The Hall seats 400 and has a stage. It is used for Gymnastics and Drama. The two Annual

                            We also have children from China, Korea, and even European backgrounds. Generally all
                            students get on well together, and have happy time learning. Class lessons are From 8a.m. to
                            4p.m. in Primary.

                        in the School do well and go on to University and College. Many of our Old Boys and Girls from
                        the School are now Doctors, Teachers, Lawyers, Architects, Dentists, Accountants, as well as a
